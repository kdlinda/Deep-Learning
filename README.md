# Deep-Learning
This repository includes all coursework for Deep Learning
# Description
Deep architectures are composed of multiple levels of non-linear operations, such as in neural nets with many hidden layers. Searching the parameter space of deep architectures is a difficult task, but learning algorithms such as those for Deep Belief Networks have recently been proposed to tackle this problem with notable success. This course will discuss the motivations and principles regarding learning algorithms for deep architectures, starting from the unsupervised learning of single-layer models such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines, and moving on to learning deeper models such as Deep Belief Networks.
The course consists of the following eight lectures (3h each), and a lab section.
